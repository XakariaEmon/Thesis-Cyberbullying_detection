# 🎓 Ensemble Learning in Cyberbullying Detection Using Transformer Models: A Multilingual and Explainable AI Approach  

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of our undergraduate thesis project, where we developed a **multilingual cyberbullying detection system** using **transformer models** and an **ensemble learning approach**.  

Our research focuses on detecting harmful online content across **English** and **Bangla**, with an emphasis on explainability and real-time usability.

## 🧠 Motivation  
Cyberbullying is a rising concern on social media platforms. The challenge is amplified by anonymity, linguistic diversity, and the lack of effective tools for **low-resource languages like Bangla**.  
Our aim was to build an inclusive system that:  
- Detects **cyberbullying in both English & Bangla**  
- Provides **explainability** behind predictions  
- Works in **real-time**
